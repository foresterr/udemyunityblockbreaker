My old Unity Arkanoid clone, that I have dug out from my digital junk bin and decided to preserve properly, for no good reason except for a bit of nostalgia.

You can play it directly in the browser thanks to Unity WebGL and GitHub Pages, here: https://foresterr.github.io/udemyunityblockbreaker/ 

This project was created in 2016 while taking Ben Tristem's Unity course on Udemy. Things have changed a bit there in the meantime, but currently the course resides at https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/ and I highly recommend it.

All graphical "assets" (well, a bunch of mostly rectangular sprites) were created with Aseprite (https://www.aseprite.org/)

Pixel particle effect created using this tutorial: https://warcher-devlog.tumblr.com/post/131193823198/unity-pixel-perfect-particles 

Finally, I can't remember where exactly I got the sound effects, but it was somewhere on https://freesound.org
